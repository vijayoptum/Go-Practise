The various factors responsible for using Cassandra are

Gigabytes to petabytes scalabilities
It could be a column-oriented information
No single purpose of failure
No want for a separate caching layer
Flexible schema style
It has versatile data storage, simple knowledge distribution, and quick writes
It supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties
Multi-datacentre and cloud capable
Data compression

SSTable?
Answer:
SSTable is also known as ‘Sorted String Table,’. 
In it memtables are stored on disk and exist for each Cassandra table. 
Being changeless, SStables don’t enable to any extent further addition and removal of data items once written.
 For every SSTable, 3 files are created by Cassandra like partition index, partition outline, and a bloom filter.

 Mem-table in Cassandra?
Answer:
It is a memory-resident data structure. once commit log, the info is written to the mem-table. Mem-table is in-memory/write-back cache house consisting of the content in key and column format. The info in mem- a table is sorted by key, and every column family consists of a definite mem-table that retrieves column knowledge via the key.
