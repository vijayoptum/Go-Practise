Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. 
Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software 
needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, 
you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.

The three main Docker components are:

1)Docker Client. Performs Docker build pull and run operations to open up communication with the Docker Host. 
The Docker command then employs Docker API to call any queries to run.
2)Docker Host. Contains Docker daemon, containers, and associated images. 
The Docker daemon establishes a connection with the Registry. 
The stored images are the type of metadata dedicated to containerized applications.
3)Registry. This is where Docker images are stored. There are two of them, a public registry and a private one. Docker Hub and Docker Cloud are two public registries available for use by anyone.

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, 
and management of containerized applications.

It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery
